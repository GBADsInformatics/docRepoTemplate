	title = {Australian cattle herd: a new perspective on structure, performance and production},
	abstract = {Context. Businesses within the Australian cattle industries and associated research and advisory agencies require accurate data on production and performance of the national herd. Currently, these are derived from survey and statistical data; the latter is expected to be accurate, but the former needs to be tested in view of information suggesting significant under-reporting.Aims. The research aimed to define the structure, performance and liveweight production of the Australian cattle herd and describe changes in reproduction, growth and survival over the past 40-50 years.Methods. Interactive static herd modelling of beef and dairy herds was reconciled each year from 1976 to 2018, using slaughter and live export statistics and surveyed dairy cow numbers. A principle applied was that model performance should dictate input variables, moderating information derived from publications and professional opinion.Key results. The Australian cattle herd fluctuated in size till the mid-1980s from when it settled into a range of 30-40 million beef cattle (12-16 Mt), exceeding survey data by 56-75\%. The dairy herd remained at similar to 10\% of the beef herd. Despite consistent herd size, productivity of the cattle herd increased from similar to 2.5 to 4.5 Mt of liveweight annually over 35 years. Half of this change was due to reductions in mortality, though similar to 1 million post-weaning-age cattle still die annually, in addition to {\textgreater}0.5 million calves from birth to weaning. Approximately a quarter each of the change was due to increased reproductive output and to steer growth. Liveweight production per beef animal increased from 70-75 kg/year to 130-135 kg/year, while liveweight production ratio increased by 0.08 and 0.12 kg/kg of cattle in male and female beef cattle respectively, to reach 0.31 kg/kg of cattle. Conclusions. The main conclusion is the size, performance, production and productivity of the Australian cattle herd are quite different from that determined from surveys. Also, there is an on-going opportunity to derive benefit from improving cattle survival, reproduction and growth and from improving the feed base. Implications. This research may have large impact on priorities for Australian beef business and associated environmental management. It is recommended that surveys be used to derive relative values to use in combination with absolute statistical data to derive accurate herd measures.},

	volume = {22},
	abstract = {Misclassification of binary outcome variables is a known source of potentially serious bias when estimating adjusted odds ratios. Although researchers have described frequentist and Bayesian methods for dealing with the problem, these methods have seldom fully bridged the gap between statistical research and epidemiologic practice. In particular, there have been few real-world applications of readily grasped and computationally accessible methods that make direct use of internal validation data to adjust for differential outcome misclassification in logistic regression. In this paper, we illustrate likelihood-based methods for this purpose that can be implemented using standard statistical software. Using main study and internal validation data from the HIV Epidemiology Research Study, we demonstrate how misclassification rates can depend on the values of subject-specific covariates, and we illustrate the importance of accounting for this dependence. Simulation studies confirm the effectiveness of the maximum likelihood approach. We emphasize clear exposition of the likelihood function itself, to permit the reader to easily assimilate appended computer code that facilitates sensitivity analyses as well as the efficient handling of main/external and main/internal validation-study data. These methods are readily applicable under random cross-sectional sampling, and we discuss the extent to which the main/internal analysis remains appropriate under outcome-dependent (case-control) sampling.},

	abstract = {Use of antimicrobials in farming has enabled the growth of intensive animal production and helped in meeting the global increase in demand for animal protein. However, the widespread use of veterinary antimicrobials drives antimicrobial resistance, with important consequences for animal health, and potentially human health. Global monitoring of antimicrobial use is essential: first, to track progress in reducing the reliance of farming on antimicrobials. Second, to identify countries where antimicrobial-stewardship efforts should be targeted to curb antimicrobial resistance. Data on usage of antimicrobials in food animals were collected from 42 countries. Multivariate regression models were used in combination with projections of animal counts for cattle, sheep, chicken, and pigs from the Food and Agriculture Organization to estimate global antimicrobial usage of veterinary antimicrobials in 2020 and 2030. Maps of animal densities were used to identify geographic hotspots of antimicrobial use. In each country, estimates of antimicrobial use (tonnes) were calibrated to match continental-level reports of antimicrobial use intensity (milligrams per kilogram of animal) from the World Organization for Animal Health, as well as country-level reports of antimicrobial use from countries that made this information publicly available. Globally, antimicrobial usage was estimated at 99,502 tonnes (95\% CI 68,535–198,052) in 2020 and is projected, based on current trends, to increase by 8.0\% to 107,472 tonnes (95\% CI: 75,927–202,661) by 2030. Hotspots of antimicrobial use were overwhelmingly in Asia (67\%), while {\textless}1\% were in Africa. Findings indicate higher global antimicrobial usage in 2030 compared to prior projections that used data from 2017; this is likely associated with an upward revision of antimicrobial use in Asia/Oceania ( 6,000 tonnes) and the Americas ( 4,000 tonnes). National-level reporting of antimicrobial use should be encouraged to better evaluate the impact of national policies on antimicrobial use levels.},

	volume = {147},
	abstract = {Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is a known endemic disease of cattle in Ethiopia; however, there is lack of a comprehensive information on the status and distribution of the disease in the country. The objectives of this systematic review and meta-analysis were to provide a pooled prevalence estimate of bTB at a national level, assess the level of in-between variance among study reports and illustrate the spatial distribution pattern in the country. Articles published on bTB from January 2000 to December, 2016 in English language were included in the review. Pubmed, CAB direct, AJOL and Web of Science were the databases used in electronic search. A total of 127 articles were retrieved from online sources, of which 56 articles were selected for data extraction based on the specified inclusion criteria. From these selected published articles, 114 animal level data were extracted for quantitative analysis. A pooled prevalence estimate of bovine tuberculosis in Ethiopia was found to be 5.8\% (95\% CI: 4.5, 7.5). In a multivariable meta-regression analysis, breed and production system explained 40.9\% of the explainable proportion of the in-between study variance computed. The prevalence of bovine tuberculosis in Holstein-Friesians, 21.6\% (95\% CI: 14.7-30.7), was higher than the prevalence in local zebus 4.1 (95\% CI: 3.4-4.9). Cattle kept under intensive and semi-intensive production systems had higher prevalence, 16.6\% (95\% CI: 12.4-21.6), of bTB than those kept in extensive livestock production system, 4.6 (95\% CI: 3.4-6.2). Bovine tuberculosis is widely distributed across major livestock producing regions of Ethiopia. However, no valid data could be retrieved from Benishanul-Gumuz, Harari and Dire Dawa. Data obtained on bTB from Somali and Gambella regional states are also few and further studies are suggested in these regions. In conclusion, this review showed that bTB in cattle in Ethiopia is widespread with high prevalence in intensive and semi-intensive management systems that keep exotic breeds and their crosses in urban and peri-urban areas. Thus, it is suggested that the design and implementation of bTB control strategies in Ethiopia should prioritize these hotspots in order to reduce the impact of the disease on the growing dairy sector.},

                  data",
        author   = "Yang, Seungmi and Hutcheon, Jennifer A",
        abstract = "PURPOSE: To illustrate how conditional growth percentiles can be
                  adapted for use to systematically identify implausible
                  measurements in growth trajectory data. METHODS: The use of
                  conditional growth percentiles as a tool to assess serial weight
                  data was reviewed. The approach was applied to 86,427 weight
                  measurements (kg) taken between birth and age 6.5 years in 8217
                  girls participating in the Promotion of Breast Feeding
                  Intervention Trial in Belarus. A conditional mean and variance
                  was calculated for each weight measurement, which reflects the
                  expected weight at a current visit given the girl's previous
                  weights. Measurements were flagged as outliers if they were more
                  than 4 standard deviation (SD) above or below the expected
                  (conditional) weight. RESULTS: The method identified 234 weight
                  measurements (0.3\%) from 216 girls as potential outliers. Review
                  of these trajectories confirmed the implausibility of the flagged
                  measurements, and that the approach identified observations that
                  would not have been identified using a conventional
                  cross-sectional approach (\pm 4 SD of the population mean) for
                  identifying implausible values. Stata code to implement the
                  approach is provided. CONCLUSIONS: Conditional growth percentiles
                  can be used to systematically identify implausible values in
                  growth trajectory data and may be particularly useful for large
                  data sets where the high number of trajectories makes ad hoc
                  approaches unfeasible.",
